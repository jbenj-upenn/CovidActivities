Our program will be a website that allows users to find random activities to do while sitting home, bored, during the covid crisis. The main focus will be on food to cook, and books to read. 

The first page will have 3 buttons, “Recipes,” “books,” and “random” which will pull from a recipe API, a book api, and a Pinterest, respectively. 

Once the user clicks recipes, they will be brought to a new div that will ask for what kind of food they would like. There will be a input box for what type of food they would like to eat, and a random button as well. The random button will pull up a random recipe. If the user searches based off of their chosen cuisine type, they will be brought to a new page where a list of 5 recipes will be presented.
