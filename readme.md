# Covid Activities
Web application that allows users to find random activities to do while sitting home, bored, during the covid crisis. The main focus will be on food to cook, and books to read. 

Initial version includes search engines for books and recipes. Users can search using various parameters to find the desired results.

Future implementations will include other search fields (random websotes, search video games etc.) as well as aditional functions (save favorites).
